## 🔧 Features

- Visual representation of sorting algorithms:
  - ✅ Bubble Sort (Implemented)
  - 🚧 Add Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- Visual representation of searching algorithms (coming soon):
  - 🔍 Linear Search
  - 🔍 Binary Search
- Adjustable sorting speed
- Random array generation
- Simple and interactive GUI
